--- 10/14/2013 ruby on rails syntax highlighting implemented (Ben S && Nate T)

--- 10/15/2013 used rails composer to generate basic app
		the folder StaticResources contains a copy of the js/css/html that is being
		served by the app - there is a copy of it's contents in myapp/public
		we should probably delete it once the layout of the project is more
		figured out
	
		Since we are still just getting moving feel free to delete any of these changes and 
		do what you want since it could be and probably will be better than this setup. 
		What are revisions for anyways?

		At this revision I am using this setup:
			running ubuntu 13.04 
			http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/
			then
			rails new myapp -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
			(I just selected 1 for most everything)
